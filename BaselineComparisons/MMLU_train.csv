"Question: Tay-Sachs is a disease caused by a recessive allele. Individuals with the genetic disorder usually do not survive more than a few years, and thus are not able to reproduce and pass on the gene. What would explain how this allele and its associated disease is preserved in the population?

A) Occasionally the gene will instead increase the fitness of the individual.
B) Tay-Sachs is asymptomatic in people who are homozygous recessive.
C) The recessive allele is actually beneficial in certain environments.
D) The disease increases the fertility of those who carry it.
E) Tay-Sachs is a dominant disease, so carriers will show symptoms.
F) Spontaneous mutation converts the dominant allele to the recessive form.
G) Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms.
H) The gene for Tay-Sachs also provides resistance to another disease.
I) The disease can be cured, so individuals with the disorder are able to reproduce.
J) The allele is not preserved and is actually decreasing in frequency.

""We found that not only was it a civil war, an effort by a people who had for years been seeking their liberation from any colonial influence whatsoever, but also we found that the Vietnamese whom we had enthusiastically molded after our own image were hard put to take up the fight against the threat we were supposedly saving them from.
""We found most people didn't even know the difference between communism and democracy. They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.""

"Question: This question refers to the following information.
""I know that whenever the subject has occurred in conversation where I have been present, it has appeared to be the opinion of every one that we could not be taxed by a Parliament wherein we were not represented. But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.""

"Question: In the context of military security, which of the following is not an obvious benefit of adopting a 'critical' theoretical approach?

A) A more critical approach to military security studies will allow the inclusion or adoption of non-realist paradigms, such as social constructivism.
B) Critical analysis of military security will draw attention back to traditional conceptions of the state-centric paradigm which have been neglected in recent years, with states favouring human security and other non-traditional approaches instead.
C) By implementing a critical analysis we can recognise that traditional conceptions of military security are no longer always salient and may need to be reconsidered.
D) A critical approach would recognise the changing ontology of security in the real world. Such changes are evident in the new ways in which war has been conducted in the 20th and 21st century.

"Question: ""Top gun"" pilots have long worried about taking a turn too tightly. As a pilot's body undergoes centripetal acceleration, with the head toward the center of curvature, the blood pressure in the brain decreases, leading to loss of brain function.
There are several warning signs. When the centripetal acceleration is $2 g$ or $3 g$, the pilot feels heavy. At about $4 g$, the pilot's vision switches to black and white and narrows to ""tunnel vision."" If that acceleration is sustained or increased, vision ceases and, soon after, the pilot is unconscious - a condition known as $g$-LOC for "" $g$-induced loss of consciousness.""

What is the magnitude of the acceleration, in $g$ units, of a pilot whose aircraft enters a horizontal circular turn with a velocity of $\vec{v}_i=(400 \hat{\mathrm{i}}+500 \hat{\mathrm{j}}) \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $24.0 \mathrm{~s}$ later leaves the turn with a velocity of $\vec{v}_f=(-400 \hat{\mathrm{i}}-500 \hat{\mathrm{j}}) \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ ?

By what principle of reason then, should these foreigners send in return a poisonous drug? Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us!

Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.
