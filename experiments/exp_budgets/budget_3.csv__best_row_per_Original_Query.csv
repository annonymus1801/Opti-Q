The slant height from the vertex to any point on the base is \\(\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nThe unwrapped sector has a radius of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and an arc length of \\(2\\pi\\), so the angle \\(\\theta\\) of the sector is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\theta \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2\\pi \\implies \\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\\pi\n\\]\n\nThe points \\((0, -1, 0)\\) and \\((0, 1, 0)\\) are directly opposite each other on the base circle.

Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
The argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history? A) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E. B) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other C) How the threat of steppe nomads shaped China's military strategy in the 1300s D) Why China and Europe had different military strategies during the Middle Ages E) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion F) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era G) How the development of gunpowder weaponry influenced the outcomes of wars in the Middle Ages H) How the geopolitical environment influenced the development of military technology in different regions I) Why China chose to invest in horse archer units instead of gunpowder weaponry during the medieval period J) How the development of gunpowder weaponry was influenced by the economic status of countries Above are multiple-choice questions (with answers) related to history.

I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: ""They call up more every day.
""Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
""But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.""

My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds.

What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.

One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nThe ideas expressed by Voltaire, above, best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?

F) Macro instructions are a form of high-level programming language, while assembler instructions are low-level codes directly executed by the hardware. G) Assembler instruction is a larger set than the macro H) Macro instructions are a sequence of assembler instructions that perform a specific task, with no need for expansion. I) Macro instructions are single abbreviations for groups of instructions, which must be expanded before translation to object code. Assembler instruction is usually a subset of the macro.
